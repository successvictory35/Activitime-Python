Watchers
========

Watchers are the parts of ActivityWatch that do all the data collecting.

For help on how to write your own watcher, see `writing-watchers`.

Default
-------

ActivityWatch comes bundled with two watchers by default:

 - `aw-watcher-afk <https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-watcher-afk>`_ - Watches for mouse & keyboard activity to detect if the user is active.
 - `aw-watcher-window <https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-watcher-window>`_ - Watches the active window and its title.

Others
------

The default watchers are collecting some of the most important data.
But there is more to collect, so here are some other watchers that let you do so.

 - `aw-watcher-web <https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-watcher-web>`_ - (Beta) A browser extension that watches the active tab and its title along with its URL.
 - `aw-watcher-spotify <https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-watcher-spotify>`_ - (Beta) Uses the Spotify Web API to get the active track.
 - `aw-watcher-chromecast <https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-watcher-chromecast>`_ - (WIP) Watches whatever your Chromecast is up to.
