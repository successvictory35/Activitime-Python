Extending ActivityWatch
=======================

So, you want to do something more with ActivityWatch? Great!

We've tried to make things easy for you (and ourselves) so here's some advice on how to get started.


Collecting more data
--------------------

To do this you'd want to write a so-called watcher. Watchers are small programs that collect data and send it off to the server.

See :doc:`writing-watchers`.


Exporting data programatically
------------------------------

Exporting data is as simple as:

TODO


Writing visualizers
-------------------

Right now, the best way to do this is to simply export the data and transform it yourself to fit the data format you need for your visualization.
In the future however, we will provide a Python library for common transforms to make things easier for you.
