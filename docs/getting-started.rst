Getting started
***************

.. note::
    We're currently working on improving the installation experience by creating installers and packages,
    but for now we only offer zip files (containing everything you need).

.. Content from aw-server/README.md should be moved here.

Installation
============

First, grab the `latest release from GitHub <https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/releases>`_.

To install from a zip-file, simply unextract it into an appropriate directory.

If you want to install from source, see `installing-from-source`.

Usage
=====

The aw-qt application is the easiest way to use ActivityWatch. It creates a trayicon and automatically starts the server and the default watchers.

Simply run the :code:`aw-qt` binary from where you unzipped the downloaded release to start it.

You might want to make it start on login, we will automate this for you in the future but for now you'll have to do it yourself.
Searching the web for "autostart application <your operating system>" should get you some good results.
