## Filing an issue

Thanks for wanting to help out with squashing bugs and more by filing an issue.

There are a few things you might consider when filing your issue:

 - Which version of ActivityWatch are you running? 
   - NOTE: There is currently no good way to find this out, sorry about that.
 - What made the issue/bug appear? (steps to reproduce)
 - Include a logfile
   - Log files can be found in different places, depending on platform:
     - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/activitywatch`
     - Linux: `~/.local/cache/activitywatch/logs`
     - Windows: `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\activitywatch\activitywatch\Logs`


**Thanks for helping make ActivityWatch better!**
